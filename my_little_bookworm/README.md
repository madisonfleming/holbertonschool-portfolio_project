# Welcome to My Little Bookworm!

## About

My Little Bookworm is a web application which helps parents to keep track of how many books their pre-schooler children have read. The target is to read 1000 books before children start school, to support language development and educational outcomes. The app is written in React & Python + FastAPI with a SQL database. 

The app is a portfolio project by C27 students at Holberton School Australia.
