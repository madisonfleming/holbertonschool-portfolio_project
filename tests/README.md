# Testing Guide

Our backend domain model tests are grouped by the app module they exercise.

Domain model tests are written with Python's `unittest` framework. 

> ℹ️ `unittest` is native to Python - no need to install it.

API tests are written with `pytest`.

> pip install -U pytest
> pytest tests/api_tests/test_child_api.py

## What makes a good test?

A good test should:
- be independent of other tests (so one test failure doesn't break other tests)
- have clear boundaries (aka clear start & stop points)
- use mocks & stubs to isolate the test within the chosen boundaries
- have specific, well-chosen assertions, which provide meaningful information about the application
- be tested to ensure that it fails when it's supposed to (ie make a breaking change in your app code & re-run your test - does it fail when you're expecting it to?)


## Run all tests locally

```bash
# Ensure that you're in a virtual env
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all of the tests
python3 -m unittest
```
